# Adamantos
Adamantos is a sandbox computer game, inspired by Minecraft and Factorio.

# Status
Currently, game is in deep development. No gameplay, almost no content. Nothing to do here.

# Concept
The concept is to merge Minecraft and Factorio, also giving a lot more flexibility in modding and mod-managing than Minecraft have.

There also will be unique content. It is planned at least.
